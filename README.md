# ANN_Model-using-tensorflow and keras
Dataset which is Housing California dataset is available 
in Keras Module.
We Are creating the ANN Architecture Using sequential API

steps Involved in the ANN Model:-
1) Importing The Packages and Load the dataset
2) Normalizing the data 
3) Creating the Train ,test and validation on the data
4) Model Creation
5) Fitting the model
6) Training the model with train dataset
7) Predicting the Output with validation dataset
8) Evaluating the Performance

This Model gives best accuracy compared to any other
Regression Model
